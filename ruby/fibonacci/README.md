# Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

* The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
* The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
* The 5 is (2+3)

In this implementation I use the Enumerator class to build a somewhat efficient fibonacci generator.
